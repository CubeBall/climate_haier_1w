Configuration Variables:
name (Required, string): The name for the climate device.
sensor (Optional, ID): The sensor that is used to measure the ambient temperature. This is only for reporting the current temperature in the frontend.
supports_cool (Optional, boolean): Enables setting cooling mode for this climate device. Defaults to true.
supports_heat (Optional, boolean): Enables setting heating mode for this climate device. Defaults to true.
receiver_id (Optional, ID): The id of the remote_receiver if this platform supports receiver. see: Using a Receiver.

All other options from Climate.

Advanced Options
id (Optional, ID): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
transmitter_id (Optional, ID): Manually specify the ID of the remote transmitter.
