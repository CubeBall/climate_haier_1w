    name: "Panasonic TV Off"

Configuration variables:
pin (Required, Pin): The pin to transmit the remote signal on.
carrier_duty_percent (Optional, int): How much of the time the remote is on. For example, infrared protocols modulate the signal using a carrier signal. Set this is 50% if you’re working with IR LEDs and to 100% if working with other things like 433MHz transmitters.
id (Optional, ID): Manually specify the ID used for code generation. Use this if you have multiple remote transmitters.
